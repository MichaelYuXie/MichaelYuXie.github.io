&lt;p> I am &lt;strong>Dr. Yu Xie&lt;/strong>, a Research Fellow in Hydrogen Combustion at the School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Leeds, UK. My research focuses on the fundamental mechanisms of flame instability, self-acceleration, and morphological evolution in premixed hydrogen combustion. &lt;/p>
